Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: rockchip: Correct pmu_io_domain regulators for
 RGxx3

Correct the pmu_io_domain regulators for the Anbernic RGxx3 series.
These domains were indivually tested by identifying a test point on the
board that corresponded to a pin within the power domain as stated in
section 2.7 of the rk3566 datasheet. The pin was then set to a GPIO
output of 1, and the voltage of the regulator was slightly adjusted up
or down until the changes matched what was observed on the pin.
